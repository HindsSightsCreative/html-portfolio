    <h1>The best movies according to Samuel</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2> <hr/>

    <h3>Butterfly effect effect</h3> 
    <p>I love this movie because it really messes with your mind. It shows how one small decision can change everything, and it makes you think about fate, regret, and how fragile life really is. Every time I watch it, I notice something new, and it always leaves me reflecting long after it ends.</p>

    <h3>Rocky</h3>
    <p>Rocky is pure motivation. It’s not just about boxing, it’s about heart, discipline, and believing in yourself when no one else does. Watching Rocky chase his dream reminds me that greatness doesn’t come from talent alone, but from persistence and refusing to quit.</p>
    
    <h3>Dead Poets Society</h3> 
    <p>I love this movie because it speaks to the power of creativity and thinking for yourself. It’s about breaking out of expectations, finding your own voice, and having the courage to live life on your own terms. The poetry, the emotion, and the message of carpe diem make it inspiring in a way that sticks with you long after the movie ends.</p>
