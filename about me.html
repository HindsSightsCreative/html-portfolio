    <p>Hi, I am Samuel Hinds. I’m a self-taught web developer in the making, passionate about building clean, functional, and visually engaging websites. I love solving problems, learning new skills, and approaching challenges with a thoughtful, detail-oriented mindset. My background in tech support taught me the importance of patience, precision, and clear communication skills, that I carry into every project I tackle.</p>

    <p>Beyond coding, I’m deeply creative. I write poetry, explore visual storytelling, and see every project as a chance to combine logic with artistry. I’m also an avid traveler, constantly immersing myself in new cultures and experiences to broaden my perspective and inspire my work.</p>

    <p>As an INFJ “Advocate,” I’m naturally reflective, curious, and committed to growth both personal and professional. I thrive in environments where I can contribute meaningfully, learn continuously, and collaborate with people who value thoughtful, intentional work. I bring not just technical skills, but a mindset that looks for solutions, connections, and the bigger picture in everything I do.</p>
